## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle AirBNB Data from 2016 to better understand:

1. Which period of the year has the highest number of listings?
2. What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle? By how much do prices spike?
3. What are the cheapest and most expensive neighborhoods?
4. What are the factors that most impact the price?
